And here goes 2021. Here's a snippet.

* What I Wrote
In 2021 I wrote 3 English articles and 2 Chinese articles.

I actually had a lot of blog ideas during this year, but the vast majority of them failed to become a full blog post. It's so hard to write something that is interesting and unique at the same time. Maybe I should lower my standard a little bit.

Oh, and there's a facelift to this blog. I feel pretty content at the current aesthetics of this blog. I'm by no means good at graphic design and typography, so I cannot make a theme that is truly groundbreaking; but at least the current theme is elegant and fast, which is good enough.

* What I Did
+ *AOSC OS* A ton of infrastructure work.
  - ~apml~ Reduced Bash syntax for describing packages. Comes with a Rust parser implementation.
  - ~Omakase~ A declarative package manager designed to replace ~apt~ in AOSC OS. Took most of my hobby time during the second half of the year. It is mostly usable now, but still need some polish.
+ *Internship* Spend my summer time doing intern.
+ *Photography* Bought my first full frame camera. Mostly used to record moments of my life.

* What I Played 
This year's new games aren't super exciting. Hopefully next year we will see some interesting releases.
+ The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD /(4/5)/
  - The classical Zelda experience.
  - Motion control is awkward though. Maybe Wiimote Plus would work better.
+ Tales of Arise /(2/5)/
  - An okay JRPG experience. Nice graphics, but story and map design aren't great.
+ Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint /(?/5)/
  - Didn't finish it. Feels super boring for some reason.

And some old games I revisited:
+ VA-11 Hall-A
  - I'm feeling like I'll play this once per year. Such a cozy experience.
+ Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands
  - Don't know why, this game feels much better than Breakpoint.

* What I Listened
New additions to my music library:
+ Beethoven, *Wiener Philharmoniker, Carlos Kleiber – Symphonies Nos. 5 & 7*
+ Prokofiev - *Romeo and Juliet*
+ Shostakovich - *Piano Trio No. 2*, *Cello Concerto No. 1*
  - Oh our boy Shosty. Super weird but super addicting.
+ *Mario Kart 8 Original Soundtrack*
  - Intro music is surprisingly jazzy and awesome.
+ *The 30th Anniversary The Legend of Zelda Game Music Collection*
  - A gift from a friend. You know who you are. :)
+ *The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Original Soundtrack*
  - *Tal Tal Heights* is crazy good.

And some old albums I listen frequently:
+ Berliner Philharmoniker, Herbert von Karajan – *Beethoven Symphony No. 9* (1976)
  - Currently my favorite interpretation of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.
+ Bach, Glenn Gould – *The Goldberg Variations* (1981)
  - It just never gets old.
+ Bach, Glenn Gould – *Art of Fugue*, *The Well-Tempered Clavier*
  - I use them as nap music
+ Sviatoslav Richter - *Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 in C minor, Op.18*
+ *VA​-​11 HALL​-​A - Second Round*
+ *Xenoblade 1&2 Original Soundtrack*

* What I Read
Mostly philosophy homework.
+ Albert Camus - *The Strangers*, *The Myth of Sisyphus*
+ Friedrich Nietzsche - *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*

* Epilogue
Has 2021 turned out to be better? Not necessarily. Hell, it might be even worse. But does that really matter?

No matter how the world is, I traveled to places I would never imagine one year ago. I experienced events I would never guessed one year ago. No matter how painful it is, it's been fresh and fun, and that's the only thing that matters.

* To 2022
Monolith Soft! Please! Xenoblade Chronicles 3! Faster!
