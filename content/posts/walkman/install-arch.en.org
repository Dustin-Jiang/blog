* WTF why do you want to do this?

"Because we can"

Well, the actual reason I did this is because the operating system on my laptop just broke down and I don't have any USB drives lying around. But I have a Walkman, another computer that runs Linux, and a good Internet connection.

(Pretty rare scenario, I admit.)

* A little bit about the background
To be specific, I'm using a ZX300a. If you really want to try this, just check you have a Walkman that supports =USB Mass Storage= mode. This mode basically turns the device into a USB flash drive.

Most Walkmans which runs the proprietary system (which is actually based on Linux[fn:1]) use this mode, but some models that uses Android does not support it (such models use the crappy MTP protocol).

Thanks to the UEFI specification, on a USB drive, there's not much thing to do to make an OS to boot. Just copy everything to the FAT32-formatted partition on the USB drive and bam! It's that simple.

However, since the Walkman is never meant to be used as a USB drive, there's some issues:

+ The drive letter is not =ARCH_201910= (name may vary based on the specific archiso version you are using).
+ Walkman's OS "intelligently" shuts down the Mass Storage mode if it thinks it is disconnected from the computer.
  - Thus, you have to be fast on turning on the USB Mass Storage mode just after the computer is launched.
  - Also, after the Linux kernel is loaded and is initializing hardware, the mode is automatically disabled. A manual mount of the drive is needed.

Fortunately, these problems can be bypassed relatively easily.

[fn:1] You can actually find the source code for ZX300 [[http://oss.sony.net/Products/Linux/Audio/NW-ZX300.html][here]], on Sony's website.

* How?
If you still think this is cool and want to try it out, here's how you do it.

** Prepare the Walkman
First, grab a computer and download the latest archiso. For now the latest version is 2019-10, so I'll use this as an example.

Then, connect the Walkman to the computer and enable Mass Storage mode. Mount the internal partition to a mount point of your choice, and copy all files from the archiso to the Walkman partition.

{{<btw>}}
I chose to use the internal storage of the Walkman (but not the microSD card) because all my songs are on the SD card and I don't want to mess up the file structure. But it is possible to use microSD card in theory.
{{</btw>}}

Just in case you don't know how to mount a ISO image to a mount point, here's how you do it:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop archlinux-2019.10.01-x86_64.iso /mnt/iso
#+END_SRC

Then, edit ~$WM_MOUNT_POINT/loader/entries/archiso-x86_64.conf~. Change the ~options~ line to[fn:2] (find your own disk id by using ~ls -al /dev/disk/by-id~)

#+BEGIN_SRC
options archisobasedir=arch archisodevice=/dev/disk/by-id/usb-SONY_WALKMAN_1234567890ABCD-0:0
#+END_SRC

[fn:2] More information on [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media#In_GNU/Linux_2][USB flash installation media - ArchWiki]].

** Boot!
Now, umount all partition of the Walkman, disable Mass Storage mode, and plug it into the desired computer. 

Start the desired computer, (quickly) enable the USB Mass Storage mode on Walkman and press F12 to choose boot device *at the same time*. Timing is essential here.

There should be two options appear at the Boot Menu. One is =USB FDD: SONY WALKMAN= and the other one is =USB HDD: SONY WALKMAN=. It seems that the FDD drive corresponds to the internal memory and the HDD drive corresponds to the SD card. So use the FDD one.

Then choose to boot from archiso. After the kernel is loaded, the Walkman disables the Mass Storage mode so the kernel cannot find the ~/run/archiso/bootmnt~ partition.

So we have to do it manually. After the Walkman finishes refreshing database, turn on Mass Storage once again. Then in the interactive fallback shell, type

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mount /dev/disk/by-id/usb-SONY_WALKMAN_1234567890ABCD-0:0 /run/archiso/bootmnt
exit
#+END_SRC

Now archiso has everything it needs to boot and it should go through the boot process flawlessly and take you to the shell. Hooray!

** Then what?
Then? You can just use your archiso as normal. Repair broken Linux, install Arch Linux, whatever you want. It's just archiso, after all.
